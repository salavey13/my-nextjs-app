      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 4 August 2024</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        By using JuniperScriptBot ("the Bot"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not use the Bot.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Usage</h2>
      <p>
        You may use the Bot for free, with limited requests. Additional requests and features are available through the purchase of a VIP membership.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">VIP Membership</h2>
      <p>
        VIP memberships are non-refundable and non-transferable. VIP status grants you additional requests and other benefits as described on our VIP page/section.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Content and Data</h2>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that any content submitted through the Bot (e.g., requests) may be used, stored, and processed by us. We do not collect or store any other personal information beyond what is necessary to connect your Discord username with your VIP status.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. You are encouraged to review the Terms periodically for any changes.
      </p>
